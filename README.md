## Course Outline
# (1.) Monte Carlo Simulation versus Resampling/Bootstrap (1/25-27/2021)

Introduction to Monte Carlo Simulation; definitions and objectives; statistical uses; simulations from
real-data (empirical) distributions); resampling and `pseudo-data'; bootstrap.

# (2.) Statistical Functionals: Bias Reduction via Jackknife & Bootstrap (1/27-29/2021)

Definition of Statistical Functions; higher-order Delta Method and asymptotic expansion for bias;
Jackknife for Bias reduction; Bootstrap for Bias Reduction

# (3.) Reference Distributions: Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals (2/1-3/2021)

# (4.) Bootstrap with Complicated Statistics (sometimes non-smooth) (2/3-5/2021)

# (5.) Proof of Consistency of Bootstrap Distributional Estimate for the Mean

# (6.) More on Statistical Functionals, "Influence Functions", and Bootstrap

# (7.) Enhanced accuracy for the Bootstrap vs. asymptotic normal approximations
the Singh Property (at least 2 lectures)

# (8.) Double and Iterated Bootstrap for Higher-order Accuracy

# (9.) Bootstrap in Regression Problems -- Bootstrapping Residuals

# (10.) Sme Settings where Bootstrap does not Work
Extensions with m-out-of-n Bootstrap and (non-bootstrap) "Subsampling"
